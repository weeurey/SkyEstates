# SkyEstate Project
An assesment completed for ClearSky Logic

# The App

This web application was made using ASP.Net Core 2.2 MVC with a little bit of touque-in-cheek humour with the properties. <br>
The Azure hosted web app can be found in the following link ;- https://skyestates20190819012025.azurewebsites.net/
# Admin Account

To log in as an admin simply use the following credentials on the web app<br>
Username: admin@admin.com<br>
Password: Password1@


To see all enquiries navagate to the following hidden page ".../home/AllEnquiry"

This will allow you to view all enquiries currently in the system.

# Assumptions
1. The user can view all properites in the application without regestering an account<br>
2. The user can make multiple enquiries about the same property<br>
3. An admin account can view all the enquiries so he can make a return e-mail<br>
4. The web application should look professional<br>
5. Users should be logged in to submit an enquiry
6. Users should only be able to submit an enquiry under the email address used to create the account
7. Imput validation should be carried out on the user input

# Extra Files
In the 'Extra Files' directory I have uploaded a SQL file that should generate the required tables for the system, if needed.<br>
I have also added in a flowchart diagram showing both the normal user and an admin user

# Issues
The current main issue is that all the images are loading in from the net slightly slowing down the application.
